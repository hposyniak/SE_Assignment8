SMELL 1 - Primitive Obsession

Player is not an object, it would be much easier (and cleaner) if player was an object class
that keeps track of whether they are in a penalty box, amount of gold coins they have
and where on the board they are. This smell is bad because it makes the code harder to read and
adds unnecessary complications and possible errors.

SMELL 2 -

Question should also be an object. Question of type pop for example.

SMELL 3 - Duplicate Code

In method roll a part of code is duplicated,


				places[currentPlayer] = places[currentPlayer] + roll;

				if (places[currentPlayer] > 11) //SMELL, risks index out of bounds error (65,55)
					places[currentPlayer] = places[currentPlayer] - 12;

				System.out.println(players.get(currentPlayer)
						+ "'s new location is "
						+ places[currentPlayer]);
				System.out.println("The category is " + currentCategory());
				askQuestion();

To fix this a simple extract method will do, and make the code more efficient and readable
