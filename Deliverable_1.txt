SMELL 1 - Primitive Obsession

    Player and question should be objects, it would be much easier (and cleaner) if player and question were
    object classes. The player class would keep track where on the board the player is, how many gold coins they have
    and whether they are in a penalty box. The question class would keep track of all the questions and their types.
    This smell is bad because it makes the code harder to read and adds unnecessary complications
    and possible errors.

SMELL 2 -

Question should also be an object. Question of type pop for example.

SMELL 3 - Duplicate Code

    In method roll and wasCorrectlyAnswered, parts of code are duplicated,


                    places[currentPlayer] = places[currentPlayer] + roll;

                    if (places[currentPlayer] > 11)
                        places[currentPlayer] = places[currentPlayer] - 12;

                    System.out.println(players.get(currentPlayer)
                            + "'s new location is "
                            + places[currentPlayer]);
                    System.out.println("The category is " + currentCategory());
                    askQuestion();

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    purses[currentPlayer]++;
                    System.out.println(players.get(currentPlayer)
                            + " now has "
                            + purses[currentPlayer]
                            + " Gold Coins.");

                    boolean winner = didPlayerWin();
                    currentPlayer++;
                    if (currentPlayer == players.size())
                        currentPlayer = 0;

                    return winner;

    To fix this a simple extract method will do, and make the code more efficient, readable and
    consistent. Duplicates affect the complexity of the code and impacts its performance.
